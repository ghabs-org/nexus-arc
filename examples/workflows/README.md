# Workflow Definitions

Example Nexus Core workflows that orchestrate agent actions.

## development_workflow.yaml

Simple **single-tier** workflow for managing development issues:

1. **Triage** — Analyse issue and classify as bug/feature/doc
2. **Route** — Conditional routing based on issue type
3. **Design** — Create design proposal for features
4. **Debug** — Root cause analysis for bugs
5. **Developer** — Implement code changes
6. **Reviewer** — Review the implementation PR
7. **Docs** — Update documentation
8. **Summarizer** — Final summary and close loop

This demonstrates:

- Multi-step orchestration
- Conditional routing via `agent_type: "router"`
- Agent hand-offs via `on_success`
- Git-native audit trail (all decisions in GitHub comments)
- Human approval gates

## enterprise_workflow.yaml

**Multi-tier** workflow demonstrating full lifecycle orchestration with three
selectable tiers:

| Tier           | Key          | Use Case     | Steps                                                                         |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Full**       | `full`       | New features | 10 steps: triage → design → develop → review → compliance → deploy → document |
| **Shortened**  | `shortened`  | Bug fixes    | 7 steps: triage → debug → develop → review → deploy → document                |
| **Fast-track** | `fast-track` | Hotfixes     | 4 steps: triage → develop → review → deploy                                   |

Additional patterns demonstrated:

- **Multi-tier workflows** — select a tier at runtime via `workflow_type`
- **Feedback loops** — reviewer rejects → back to develop
- **Compliance gate** — security/privacy review before deploy
- **Human approval gates** for deployments
- **Error handling** and per-step timeout configuration

## social_media_marketing_workflow.yaml

Marketing-oriented workflow for automated content planning, review, compliance,
and publishing.

This demonstrates:

- Reusing the enterprise agent roster for a non-software workflow
- Dry-run-first rollout for external platform publishing
- Shared campaign context passed across design, implementation, review, and deploy
- Requester-scoped credential expectations for OAuth-backed platform adapters

### Loading a specific workflow

```python
from nexus.core.workflow import WorkflowDefinition

# Load the shortened (bug fix) tier
wf = WorkflowDefinition.from_yaml("enterprise_workflow.yaml", workflow_type="shortened")

# Get prompt context for a specific agent in the full tier
context = WorkflowDefinition.to_prompt_context(
    "enterprise_workflow.yaml",
    current_agent_type="developer",
    workflow_type="full",
)

# Load the social marketing workflow definition
marketing = WorkflowDefinition.from_yaml("social_media_marketing_workflow.yaml")
```

## Creating Your Own Workflow

See `examples/README.md` for instructions on defining agents and workflows.

## n8n Workflow Templates

Importable n8n equivalents are generated under `examples/workflows/n8n/`.
They keep n8n as the state machine and call the Nexus command bridge for state
updates and guarded OpenCode execution on developer steps.

Each generated workflow starts with `Prepare Nexus Input`. For a Manual Trigger
run, edit that Code node's `manualInput` fields before executing it:

- `task`: the feature, bug, or delivery request to work on.
- `project_key`: the Nexus project key recorded on the bridge run.
- `issue_number`: optional issue reference.
- `repo_dir`: the concrete allowlisted git checkout for developer/OpenCode
  steps. This is important for multi-repo project workspaces.

Webhook, Form, or parent workflows can pass the same fields on the incoming
n8n item instead of editing `manualInput`.

Regenerate them after changing workflow YAML:

```bash
nexus translate to-n8n examples/workflows/enterprise_full_workflow.yaml \
  -o examples/workflows/n8n/enterprise_full_workflow.json
```
